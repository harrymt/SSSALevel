# Student Tracking System #
I created a system that tracked student profiles for a Oxford Open Learning Tutors as part of my A-Level Computing course. I created a program with a smooth GUI using Visual Basic that kept a record of all the students the tutor has received and produced a printable tracking sheet for selected pupils.

I used Visual Basic to program the GUI and SQL back end.
